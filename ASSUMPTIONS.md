- I made the assumption that the input will always be correct and there is always at least one line. It simplifies the code and help me focus on the core of the requested task: creating the algo to find the minimal path.
- I made the assumption that all the input numbers will be positive. Same reason as the previous one.
- I decided that the addition of all the numbers of the triangle would be inferior to the max value of `Long`. Same reason as the previous one.
- A line which contains more int than expected will be considered valid. The int which are not usefull will be discarded.
- A line which contains less int than expected will be considered valid. The int which are missing will be replaced by an end node. The missing int will be considered to be the childs of the right-most nodes of the parent line.
- I decided that it was ok to have `println` in the test function. It helps having an idea of how efficient is our program.
